## --> What Is Flutter?

    -- Flutter is a tool that allows us to build native cross-platform apps for android and Ios with one programming language and codeBase.

    - We are not building apps that runs on browser, we are not building apps which get wrapped by native apps.

    - You write in one programming language so you work on one project and in the result you get 2 different apps (android,ios).

    - Flutter refers to 2 major things. one is sdk (software development kit) a collection of tools that allows you write one codebase because its include tools to then compile this code which normally would not run on Ios and android into native machine code that does run on these platforms because if there is one programming language which on these platforms(android,ios) we would not need flutter. but there is not.

    - The one programming language flutter use doesnt work on both android and ios so it needs to compiled for native machine code for ios and native machine code for android. so we have code that does run on these platforms. that complition tasks and other things are all part of flutter. but its not only collection of tools but it also gives us everything which we need to create beautiful app.

    - It gives you a framework, a widget library for that one programming language which called Dart. which we can use to build beautiful flutter apps.

## --> Dart

    - it gives you vast collection of reusable ui building blocks, these are so called widgets, so these are things like tabs, buttons, inputs, dropdown and much more out of the box. you can customize and style them to build user interfaces. then that code which you built with the help of the framework that get compiled into native machine code with the help of sdk.

    - Dart is a programming language which focues on building frontend interfaces. its not limited only to build mobile apps that just flutter uses it for. so we are gonna focus on flutter how it use dart.

    - Its object-oriented and strongly typed language and its syntax is bit of mixture of Javascript,Java And C#.

    - Flutter built up on dart and its framework for dart. dart is actually a programming language which we are using and flutter is collection of tools like widgets, utillity function and a set of features and these features are implemented using dart.
