## --> Dart Functions

```
    void main(){
        print('hello')
    }
```

-- `void` is type here which tell that this function returns nothing.

-- `main` is the name of this function, generally we can give any name to our function but in this case `main` keyword is dart special function which is entry point of our dart application. dart automatically calls the `main` function for you when the app starts.

## --> Dart Types

-- dart is strongly and strictly typed langauage. therefore we should use types for arguments we passing on function or what function is return type for that too.

-- dart has dynamic type too which adapt based on the received arguments but we should strongly avoid that too.

-- string :- 'hello', '2', "Ash"
-- integers :- 10, -2
-- float :- 10.5, -10.56

```
    #Example

    void addNumbers(int num1,int num2){
        print(num1 + num2);
    }
```

-- in above example we can see that we add `int` keyword before the argument which tells it that argument we recieve can only be integer. otherwise if we pass string we will get compilation error.
-- also this functions return nothing so we added `void` keyword before the function name.

```
    #Example

    int addNumbers(int num1,int num2){
        return num1+num2;
    }
```

-- we can also return something from the function if we use `return` keyword but then we also have to set the return type of the function. we cant use void there.

## --> Idea Of Variables

```
     var firstName = 'Ashish'
        firstName = 'Kreideprinz'
     String lastName = 'Albedo'
```

-- variable `firstName` holds the data for us in memory so we can use it later somewhere else.

-- to create a variable we have to use `var` keyword following along with the variable name(firstName) then equal operator to store some data('Ashish') in it.

-- we only use `var` keyword once when we create it but later if we introduce it or change its value we only call it by the variable name.

```
    double num1 = 5;
```

-- we can also create variable beside using `var` using the type of data it holds.

-- dart has a feature called `type Inference` which can infer the type of data for variable which you will store here by the value you have on the right side. so its better to use `var` keyword to create variables.

```
    // var someNumbers;
    double someNumbers;
```

-- in this case you can see that variable is uninitialized which means some points later we want to assign a value to this variable so it is considered a good practice that we use the type of data which we will store later instead of var.

## --> Object-Oriented Programming

-- Dart is Object-Oriented Programming Language which means everything in dart is object.
-- Everything in dart is basically a data structure with a lot of different information in it.

```
    Class Person{
        String name = 'Ash';
        int age = 22;
    }

    void main(){
        var p1 = Person()
    }
```

-- You can create objects using `Class`. A Class allows u to define blueprint for objects And Class Has a Name which start with first letter of it in capital-case. they can also holds variables or properties and also default value to it.

-- We can call the Class using `Person()` . this will instantiate this call and store in variable `p1`. we can access the property using `.` dot notation (p1.name).
