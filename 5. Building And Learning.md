## -> Building

-- In Flutter everything is widget. so to create a widget we need to create a class because widget is special type of object.

-- A Widget which can be seen on the screen is not that trivial to create because in the end , the pixels on the screen do need to be controlled. We dont have to write that logic ourself because flutter does that all behind the scene.

```
    class MyClass extends __HereComesTheFlutterClassName__ {

    }
```

-- Our class here now uses a feature called inheritance that means that this build up on base class, gets all the feature of the class and only add new features to it.

-- We do inherit this adding `extends` keyword after the classname and before the curly braces that informs dart that this class will be based on some other class and you can only extend one class at a time.

-- Now class we want to write here is provided by the flutter itself.

```
    import 'package:/flutter/material.dart'
```

-- class from flutter which we need to use is not stored on our project but somewhere on our machine (C:/Users/{Name}/Flutter). connection to that folder is established by the pubspec.yaml file so we can import that using `import` keyword. `material.dart` is one of the file which flutter expose to us.

```
    class MyClass extends StatelessWidget{
        Widget build(BuildContext context){
            return MaterialApp(home:Text('Hello))
        }
    }
```

-- `material.dart` file has a class which allows us to create our own widget thats called stateless widget.

-- We also have to call `build` method inside the class. remember classes can hold functions(methods) too beside properties.

-- we can see `context` argument inside our `build` method its special type of object which will be passed into `build` method automatically because u will never call that method flutter does whenever its need to draw something on the screen, in the end its holds some meta information about our app and about this widget we are building. and also add type annotation which in the end is `BuildContext`.

-- `BuildContext` is special object type provided by the flutter in the material.dart file.

-- `build` method need to return a type `Widget` because we are working with widgets here, our entire app is widget.

-- And We return some widget from our build method which is `MaterialApp()` also provided by material.dart file.

-- `MaterialApp()` accepts named-arguments which means we dont pass data in order here, because that has lots of possible arguments we can set, which are optional in the end. we target an argument by its name. therefore we only need `home` argument for now.

-- `home` is basically the core widget which flutter will bring on the screen when this entire app is mounted on the screen and here we can use another `text` widget.

-- `MaterialApp()` is a class not method which can accepts arguments because of the `constructor()` function.

```
    void main(){
        runApp(MyApp())
    }
```

-- Now to run the app we need to execute some code which takes our widget and draws it to the screen. for that there is another special function provided by the material.dart called `runApp()`.

-- `runApp()` takes our widgets tree and draws something on the screen based on that widget tree. for that we need to tell `runApp()` what our core widget is thats `MyApp()`.

-- `runApp()` takes that`(MyApp())` and call `build` method for us.
