-- We can also create seprate file to manage smaller widget. thats help us in performance and also considered a good practice.

```
    #lib/question.dart
    import 'packages:/flutter/material.dart'

    class Question extends StatelessWidget{
        final String questionText;

        Question(this.questionText)

        @override
        Widget build(BuildContext context){
            return Text(questionText)
        }
    }
```

-- in above example we create a seperate file for Question Widget which returns text in the end.

-- `Question` class expect a string in its constructor function. notice we are using positional argument inside constructor because its single argument we are expecting.

-- `final` keyword we added before questionText property tells it that after when this widget get build and after receiving `questionText` data. questionText property will not change or not mutate. if we think that it will change because of onPressed function thats not the case. because when onPressed trigger this widget will get re-build again so technially we are not mutating the data instead we are rebuilding the entire widget and then add `questionText` data there.

-- also this widget is `Stateless` but our app state will be changed because as we learned earlier `Stateless Widget` get re-build when inputData change externally. so when `questionText` data changed externally this trigger this widget to re-build.

```
    #lib/main.dart
    import 'packages:/flutter/material.dart'
    import './question.dart'

    void main() => runApp(MyApp())

    class MyApp extends StatefulWidget{
        @override
        State<MyApp> createState() => _MyAppState();
    }

    class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp>{
        var _questions = [
                'Who Is The Strongest In Tower Of God?',
                'Who Is The Protagonist Of Tower Of God?'
            ];

        var _questionIndex = 0;

        void _selectAnswer(){
            setState((){
                _questionIndex = _questionIndex + 1;
            })
        }

        @override
        Widget build(BuildContext context){
            return MaterialApp(home: Scaffold(
                appBar: AppBar(
                    title: 'This Is Quiz'
                ),
                body: Column(
                    children: [
                        Question(_questions[_questionIndex]),
                        ElevatedButton(onPressed: _selectAnswer,child:Text('Jahad')),
                        ElevatedButton(onPressed: _selectAnswer,child:Text('Enryu')),
                        ElevatedButton(onPressed: _selectAnswer,child:Text('Urek Mazino')),
                    ]
                )
            ))
        }
    }
```

-- we import file at the top using `import './question.dart'`. basically import statement will be written like first comes flutter packages , then we can import our package.

-- below inside `body -> Column() -> children[]` instead of `Text()` we are using our own widget which we imported `Question()` and passing question inside that which we can grabbed using constructor of Question class.

-- also we can notice that we are using private properties syntax `_` on variables and on methods. which tells those that they cant be changed outside of this file.
