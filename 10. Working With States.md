## --> Working With State (Incorrectly On Stateless Widgets)

```
    void main() => runApp(MyApp());

    class MyApp extends StatelessWidget{
        var questions = ['What\'s your favourite color?','What\'s your favourite animal?']
        var questionIndex = 0

        void selectAnswer(){
            questionIndex = questionIndex + 1;
        }

        @override
        Widget build(BuildContext context){
            return MaterialApp(home: Scaffold(
                appBar:AppBar(title: Text('Quiz')),
                body: Column(children:<Widget>[
                    Text(questions[questionIndex]),
                    RaisedButton(child:Text('Answer1'),onPressed:selectAnswer),
                ])
            ))
        }
    }
```

-- what we want to do in this app when user click on any answer it takes him to the next question. that can be done incrementing `questionIndex` value by 1 because we passed `selectAnswer` function on `onPressed`.

-- but after doing all this we cant achieve our end goal because we are working with state here. when user click on the button app state changes. but since our class `MyApp` extends `StatelessWidget`, our app state will always remain constant it will never change.

## --> Understanding `State`

-- in general `State` is `data/information` which our app or widgets uses. state can be username or in ourcase it is `questionIndex` of the question we want to show.

-- `appWideState` would be things like is the user authenticated or not etc.

-- `widgetState` can be when some data we are loading from server show if we showing spinner. in our case which question is currently selected and that state can and typically will change in application.

-- typically in apps things change then why we using `StatelessWidget`. typically in our application we will have more than one widget so there are can be some widget which are there only for to output something like the `Text()` widget. `Text()` is a widget which has not state builtIn its get text from outside passedIn, it does nothing it does not react when we click on it.

-- but in our app we want to change state or change data so we can use `StateFul Widget`.

## -> Difference Between Stateful And Stateless Widget

```
    inputData[data can externally Change]
        |
     Widget
        |
    RendersUI[Gets Re-Renders when input data changes]
```

-- in `Stateless Widget` we have widget and build method which is used to render UI. now we can pass data in from outside into the stateless widget through the constructor of the that class. and this data can change and actually flutter would rebuild that widget when that external data changes but inside of the widget class, that data will never change. we can only receive new data from outside and that will basically rebuild the widget.

```
    inputData[data can externally Change]
          |
        Widget
    [InternalState]
          |
    RendersUI[Gets Re-Renders when input data changes or local state changes]
```

-- now stateful widget also have build method which builds widget and render ui. but here we can also get input data passed in through the constructor of the widget , we can also have some `internal-state` and thats the core thing here and this widget will get re-rendered. so the user interface will get updated whenever internal(local) or external state changes. thats the core difference.

## --> Converting To Stateful Widget.

-- in our case our app doesnt take inputData but it can also not internally change because we are using statelessWidget.

-- simply renaming it into `StatefulWidget` not gonna work though.

## --> Steps.

-- first rename `StatelessWidget` to `StatefulWidget`.

```
    class MyApp extends StatefulWidget{

    } #First Class

    class MyAppState extends State<MyApp>{
        Widget build(BuildContext context){
            return MaterialApp();
        }
    } #Second Class
```

-- `StatefulWidget` is bit more complex than `StatelessWidget` Its actually not one class but combination of two class.

-- For the naming convention we convert second class name with `firstClass_Name + State = MyAppState` and it exends `State` and `State` is a generic class.

-- Why do we have 2 classes first of all ? basically the way flutter works internally, the widget itself can be recreated. when external data changes it `(class MyApp extends StatefulWidget{} #First Class)` will be reacreated basically. the `State` however is persistent its attached to that widget so its attached to the element in the user interface which you see but unlike that class its technically not recreated. so thats important for storing your state so that when your question index changes and external data passed into the widget itself changes, only that is rewritten , is rebuilt and our data in second class not reset.

-- State can be persistent in second class. while first class widget itself can be rebuilt. now we need to tell the flutter that this State class Belongs to the this widget class, flutter doesnt take name `(MyAppState)` as an indicator that this belongs to the widget class. to setup connection we need 2 things.

-- first of all `State` is generic type so we have to add `angled-brackets<>` there and in between we add pointer at our class(MyApp) there.

-- second part has to be done inside of the `MyApp` class. we have to add new method there called `createState()`. this createState method dont take any argument but in the end it had to return state object which is connected to the statefulWidget. and we return `MyAppState()` with this we connected both classes. we also have `@override` again because createState() is a method provided by StatefulWidget its need to be overriden deliberately.

-- now with this change, the build method is inside the state, not inside the widget because state holds the data that is used by the build method.

-- even after doing all this nothing changes in ui. well reason for that is that still,even with this transformation to stateful widget and state, flutter doesnt automatically update and re-render the user interface just because we tap the button and thats good , because for performance it would be not great if flutter re-render on every tap of the user. because if we tap and flutter takes this as indicator to re-render everything that would be a horrible-performance issue. instead we have to tell flutter that we are about to change the state and when this state changed it should re-render this widget.

```
    ...
        void changeAnswer() {
            setState(() {
            questionIndex = questionIndex + 1;
            });
        }
    ...
```

-- we do that by wrapping the code where we do change data inside of our state. questionIndex is reflected because it controls which question is shown, so we wrap that in `setState()` function provided by State class which takes anonymous function and we move property(questionIndex) which also use in build.

## --> Brief Look Behind SetState Method

-- SetState is a function that forces flutter to re-render userInterface. however not entire app userInterface. build is getting called when u call setState() that is why you see the change then.

-- also thats why in StatelessWidget u didnt saw any change because build() was not called therefore this widgetTree never got rebuilt and therefore this updated never made it to the userInterface.
