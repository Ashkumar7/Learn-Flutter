## --> Installing Flutter And Android Studio

    - We can download flutter.zip file from `https://flutter.dev` and extract it to C:/users/{Name}/
    - and then point out the path to system variables path of C:/users/{Name}/flutter/bin
    - Now we can access flutter through cmd of our window machine by using `flutter` command. and can check additional install required to run the app using `flutter doctor`.
    - `flutter doctor` will tell us to install android studio which we can get from `https://developer.android.com/studio` and install it.
    - after opening android studio we have to configure some sdk_manager->sdk_tools and install `Android SDK Command-Line Tools`.
    - then we have to configure AVD Manager and install android image of listed devices.
    - if we run `flutter doctor` we will see everything setup.
    - then we can run flutter app from vscode using Run Without Debugging.
    - Our app will start running and it will auto-reload on code changes automatically.

## --> Walkthrough Of Files And Folders.

    - `.idea` folder here holds configuration files for android studio.
    - `android` folder here is super important because its hold complete android project which we can create without flutter also. this is the folder in the end which flutter sdk will use to kind of merge with your flutter code you could say. so when our flutter codes get complied to native code it will basically get injected into this `android` folder and that is the android project which will be built into real android app.
    - `built` folder is also super important this holds output of our flutter application and this folder also generated and managed by flutter sdk.
    - `lib` folder is important folder for us where we will do 99% of our work. it is the folder where we will add all our dart files.
    - `test` folder is the folder it allow us to write tests for our application, automated tests, so basically code that runs our code and tests it for certain things. certainly important once you are a bit of a more advanced dart and flutter developer but not important for us right now.
    - `.gitingore` file is a file which we get when we work with git source code management tool which helps us to ignore some files and folder to not add into git staging area.
    - `.metadata`,`{YOUR_PROJECT_NAME}.iml`,`pubspec.lock` and `.packages.` file is managed by flutter sdk.
    - `pubspec.yaml` file is which we gonna work on it. this is a file which allows u to mostly manage these dependencies of your project. here you can configure which third-party packages your project might be using. you can also configure other things here like fonts you want to use, or images you wanna use in your application
