## --> Constructors And Named-Arguments

```
    class Person{
        String name = 'Ash';
        int age = 22;
    }
```

-- Having default value of `name` and `age` doesn't make sense because each person has different name and age.

```
    var p1 = Person('Kreide',25);
```

-- So we can accept additional argument when instantiating class.

```
    class Person{
        String name;
        int age;

        Person(String inputName,int inputAge){

        }
    }
```

-- But we also have to grab those argument inside our class. using `constructor` function. in other programming language we call constructor simply using `constructor` keyword but in dart we use ClassName directly. i used `inputName` and `inputAge` to avoid confusion. though we can also choose the same name because dart has feature called `Scoping` which means if u have variable of class same name as argument of constructor function it will not override. it would simply create new variable inside `Person()` and it always create new variables for new argument and they would not clash because behind the scene dart manage the seperation between your class level variables and function or constructor level variables.

```
    class Person{
        String name;
        int age;

        Person(String inputName,int inputAge){
            name = inputName;
            age = inputAge;
        }
    }
```

-- now inside the constructor body we can assign inputName and inputAge to classLevel variables (name,age)

```
    class Person{
        String name;
        int age;

        Person(String name,int age){
            name = name;
            age = age;
        }
    }
```

-- but if we had the same name dart would not be able to figure out which name and age are which.

```
    class Person{
        String name;
        int age;

        Person(String name,int age){
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }
    }
```

-- therefore it gives us special keyword `this` keyword. which refers to the class itself. if we use `this` that means we are referring to the class level variables.

```
    class Person{
        String name;
        int age;

        Person({String name,int age}){
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }
    }

    var p1 = Person(name:'Ash',age:'22')
```

-- we can also use named-arguments that means we can simply wrap our function arguments inside curly braces. now that means all arguments are now optionals and you target them with name when creating data `var p1 = Person(name:'Ash',age:'22')`.

-- named-arguments are actually great for constructors and function which takes lots of argument and we dont have remember which argument goes into which position. therefore we can provide argument in any order we want.

```
    class Person{
        String name;
        int age;

        Person({String name,int age = 32}){
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }
    }
```

-- we can define our default value directly to the argument `int age = 32`. now if we dont provide age when creating data default age value will be used.

```
    class Person{
        String name;
        int age;

        Person({@required String name,int age = 32}){
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }
    }
```

-- we can also add special annotation `@required` so compiler yells at you if u dont provide value for that named-argument. this feature not built into dart but into flutter.

```
    class Person{
        String name;
        int age;

        Person({this.name,this.int age = 32})
    }

    var p1 = Person(age:30,name:'Ash')
```

-- we can also get rid of our constructor body and can use the same class variable name as constructor variable name. so we dont have to write and assign the variable to each other. it (constructor variables) without the type assignment(because we infer that from class variables) automatically assigned to class variables with help of `this` keyword. but name should match.

## --> @override Annotation

```
    void main(){
        runApp(MyApp())
    }

    class MyApp extends StatelessWidget{
        @override
        Widget build(BuildContext Context){
            return MaterialApp(home:Text('Hello!'));
        }
    }
```

-- Technically Thats not required to use our app will work without it.

-- @override is a `decorator` which is provided by the dart.

-- it just there to make our code bit cleaner and clearer.

-- this makes it clear that we are delibaretly overriding the build method which is provided by the stateless widget. it exists there but we provided by our own implementation and actually stateless widget forces us to override it. we dont have option to not overriding.

-- this is basically a comman and good practice. if u provide a method which already exist in a class you are extending `(StatelessWidget)` then u should add `@override` to make it clear that you are not accidentally overwriting this already existed method but deliberately because when u add your build method here and statelesswidget also had one, then one of statelessWidget will not be considered for my app but your own one will and that is something that you absolutely have to do here.

## --> Arrow Functions

```
    void main() => runApp(MyApp())

    class MyApp extends StatelessWidget{
        @override
        Widget build(BuildContext Context){
            return MaterialApp(home:Text('Hello!'));
        }
    }
```

-- You can also use arrow function `() =>` to convert you function with single expression if it exist inside of the function body. also result of expression will also be returned automatically so we dont have to write that ourself.
