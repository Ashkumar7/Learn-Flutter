## --> Architecture Of Flutter Application

    - Flutter has idea of building user interfaces as code.
        - Ui As Code: Build A Widget Tree
    - UI as code approach mean you write in code. you build and style in code. there is no drag and drop editor but we work everything in code.
    - Flutter apps embrace other platform(Android,IOS) differences whilst being on one codebase. so we work on one project but we will have ability to create difference user interfaces at some points or some parts of app if we need to for different platforms.
    - So Flutter gives you access base on platform like if you are on Android you can execute code 'A' or if You are on IOS you can execute code 'B'.

## --> Everything Is A Widget

    - Everything is widget like if have an app which have a tab thats widget. if you have text input thats also a widget if you have button thats also a widget too. even whole page is widget and whole app is wrapped in one main widget.

    - Tab widget (huge Widget) can have smaller widget like icon or edit button. therefore entire app is a widget tree.
        -- Example -> Root Widget(App Itself), Then inside that you have different screens then inside that you have different sections like buttons,inputs etc.

## --> How Flutter/Dart Compiled To Native Apps?

    -  So we have Flutter Api Which stands for widgets and function which we use in dart then that compiled into native apps for android and ios that happens with the help of flutter sdk. which then you get you apps which based on your code but thats not you code instead it was compiled version of the code therefore you really ship code that runs of different platforms. thats highly optimised and performed thats the huge advantage of Flutter.

    - Flutter doesnot use platform primitives mean by that we give set of instruction (raisedButton()) which tells flutter to render a button in that part of your widget tree. now you could think what would happen when your code gets compiled to that native code is that this raisedButton() get translated to ios which tells it give ios default button (UIButton) or in android its (widget.button) which are native buttons which are the part of native development environments thats what not happens instead flutter has its own implementations because flutter directly control every pixel on the screen.

    - So Flutter doesnt compile your code to some native equivalence or native alternatives instead flutter ships with its own engine which controls the entire screen, everything user see and renders every pixel on its own.
